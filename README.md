# Old Instructions used

Please aware that my code follow the old version's instructions. That is, my code includes LRU, PLRU, Optimal and FIFO, and they correspond to argument 0, 1, 2, and 3. 
I have asked Dr. Lou and got his permission to use the old instruction. Please check the argument carefully so that you won't get the right outputs. Thank you!!
